%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% `comment` is a package that enables you to omit sections by simply
% enclosing the unwanted stuff inside `\begin{comment}  \end{comment}`
\usepackage{comment}  % This package lets you omit sections of code


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% `hyperref` is a package that gives you hyperlinks in your pdf,
% which can be very helpful for those reading it on a computer
% or tablet.  You get the default color options for links with
%
%          \usepackage{hyperref}
%
% but I think the default colors are VERY ugly and distracting,
% so I use the following options:
\usepackage[
  colorlinks=true,
  urlcolor=black,
  linkcolor=black,
  citecolor=black
]{hyperref}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% The `geometry.sty` package is for customizing page layout
%
\usepackage[  
  top    = 3cm,  %% <<== adjust top margin by changing this number
  left   = 4cm,  %% <<== adjust left margin by changing this number
  bottom = 3cm,  %% <<==  ...etc...
  right  = 4cm
]{geometry}


%% The next line incorporates some macros employed by Bob's students.
\usepackage{cmu-macros}  %% see the `cmu-macros.sty` file for details.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% The `proof-dashed.sty` package is for typesetting inference rules
%
\usepackage{proof-dashed}
%
% Look at the comments in the file `proof-dashed.sty` for more details
% about how to use it, but looking at this one example may be sufficient.
% (Notice you start with the base of the tree and work up.)
%
% Example: The LaTeX commands
%
%		\infer[R2]{ E }
%                     { A & \infer[R1]{ D }
%                                   { B & C } }
%
%                produce following derivation tree
%
%                       B C
%                      ----- R1
%                  A     D
%                 ---------- R2
%                     E
%
% Note: spacing doesn't matter, so you could write the above derivation
% like this:  \infer[R2]{E}{A & \infer[R1]{D}{B & C}}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% `tikz` is a package for making diagrams
% `tikz-cd` has additional support for commutative diagrams
%  We don't need it for this document, but if you will add diagrams,
%  be sure you have the `tikz-cd.sty` file in latex search path,
%  and then uncomment the next line.
%% \usepackage{tikz-cd}  


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% `fancy` is a package for making ``fancy'' headers and footers.
%
% If you want fancy headers and footers, then uncomment the next three lines.
%
%%   \pagestyle{fancy}
%%   \lhead{Democrat}   \chead{Moderate}   \rhead{Republican}
%%   \lfoot{}  \cfoot{\thepage}   \rfoot{}
%    \renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{0.4pt}
